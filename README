Files
#####
1. profiler_benchmark.py

This script profiles the targeting GPU benchmark and generates a profile file that contains the dynamic instrcutions of the benchmark. Please note that due to that a complete set of dynamic instructions of all threads belong to the benchmark is extreamly time-consuming, the script only produces a set of instructions for one block.

2. faultInjection_benchmark.py

This script reads PCs from the profile file and injects faults into a random PC in a randomly selected block and thread. What users need to change for different benchmarks could be 

a. filtering the profile so only avaliable PCs are selected because different benchmarks get threads launched in different ways on hardware.

b. checking the correctness of the benchmark. 

3. configure.py

This file defines configurations for each benchmark. It should be modified based on the GPU kernel that is running. 

4. generateDynamic.py

This script runs the benchmark through CUDA-GDB and records all the kernel information. Then it modify the profile file automatically to enable the fault injection.

5. analysis tools

analysis.py and processCrash.py ( not used for fault injection but for collecting results )

Usage
#####

The proper order of using the tool is to firstly profile the benchmark by running

"python profiler_benchmark.py"

Then it will generate a profile file named benchmark_kernel_node_profiler.log. Please note that it is necessary to see if the current block/thread has finished and stop the profile by hand. Normally the profiler would watch for the first block block (0,0,0). Next run configure.py using 

"python generateDynamic.py"

to modify the profile file for adding kernel information into it. Last, modify faultInjection_benchmark.py on the two points that described in the above section based on the profile and run fault injection

"python faultInjection_benchmark.py"

By default the fault injection will last for 3000 runs. But usually it gets to 1000 activated runs less than 3000. This is another part that manual stop is needed.
